Open the project inside Android Studio. Click on the hammer (top middle of the screen) to build the project. Second box to the right should show available emulators. If there are none, click on the device manager icon, then click on create device, there will be a list of devices to choose from for an emulator. Go through this process. After you have an emulator selected, click the run app button right of the drop down.


Unable to upload Night-Run/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk, larger than 25 mb. This doesn't seem to cause any issues running the game on the emulators. File generates after build.
Other files with same issue:
Night-Run/app/build/intermediates/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
Night-Run/app/build/intermediates/processed_res/debug/out/resources-debug.ap_

Also unable to upload folders that were empty of any files.
